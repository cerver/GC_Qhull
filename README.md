Introduction
------------

GCQhull is an interface between GC and Qhull. You can create any 1D point array to construct Voronoi, Delaunay, and convex Hulls in 2D and 3D. 


Installation and Requirements <a id="install" />
-----------------------------

Generative components 8.11.9.169 or above is required.  
Generative Components is a free standalone application by Bentley Systems and can be dowloaded here
